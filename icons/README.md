# Icon Instructions

Since we can't generate actual PNG files here, you'll need to create the following icon files:

## Required Icons:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Icon Design:

The icons should represent an attendance/people tracking concept. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Simple design**: A blue circle with 2-3 white dots representing people
2. **Meeting theme**: A simplified meeting room icon with people dots
3. **List theme**: A checklist icon with dots or checkmarks

## Quick Creation Methods:

### Option 1: Use the SVG template

- The `icon16.svg` file in this folder shows a simple design
- Convert this SVG to PNG at different sizes using online tools like:
  - https://convertio.co/svg-png/
  - https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/convert/svg-to-png

### Option 2: Use online icon generators

- https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
- https://www.canva.com/create/icons/
- https://icons8.com/icon-maker

### Option 3: Simple colored squares (for testing)

- Create solid colored squares in any image editor
- Use the Google Meet blue color: #1a73e8
- Add simple white text or shapes

## Temporary Solution:

For now, you can create simple colored PNG files with the text "AT" (Attendance Tracker) to test the extension functionality.

The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon instead.
